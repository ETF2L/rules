## 1.Introduction

Competitive Team Fortress 2 in Europe is run by ETF2L, the European Team Fortress 2 league, a community organization running different competitive formats voluntarily.

### 1.1 What Format To Pick

There are a few different formats you can pick from when playing in ETF2L. The most common and popular are 6s and Highlander.
6s is a 6 versus 6 format, played on 5cp or koth maps.
Individual skill and understanding of the format is very important and the key to improving. Coming from a casual background, this will be very new to you.
There are specific maps made only for competitive, and their own custom ruleset as well.
Highlander is a 9 versus 9 format, played on payload or koth maps. Each class is represented once on a team,and some familiar maps from the casual pool are played
here as well. Coming from casual, this might be more familiar to you. Team coordination is more important than individual skill.

6s experience and Highlander experience can be very different, but you are not stuck with playing only one of these two.
Starting out though, it’s recommended to stick to one format until you get a good grip.

Important to consider when picking a format is which class you want to play, because not every class is relevant across all formats.

### 1.2 What Class To Pick

Before you pick a class, you need to have picked a format first. Some classes may be restricted or aren't commonly played.
For 6s, the lineup is as follows:
    - 2 scouts
    - 2 soldiers
    - 1 demoman
    - 1 medic

Other classes, like sniper or spy, can be seen occasionally, but are outside of specific short term strategies considered too slow or not viable.

For Highlander, you are allowed/required to play one of every class. If you already found a class in casual that you enjoy, you might want give that one a try.
Be aware though, that some classes play differently than in a pub environment, but these differences can be learned along the way.

### 1.3 How To Find A Team

There are multiple ways to find a team, the most straightforward one is going on the ETF2L recruitment board
and message some of the team leaders (under the “Teams” tab) on steam/discord or create one post yourself under the “players” tab.

An example post of a new player could look like this:
“Looking to get into competitive TF2! I have XXX hours and I’m free from YYY to ZZZ, preferably playing AAA (class) but might do BBB (another class potentially)”

Before doing so, you might want to understand the different divisions and their corresponding skillevel first. If you are starting out, you should look for “open”,
the entry division for new players.
To note is, that even if you feel like you are mechanically a very good player already, giving the lowest division a try first will give you a good introduction to how competitive Team Fortress 2 is being played, as many more skills than mechanics are required.

Other ways to find teams include dedicated “looking for player/team” discord channels, which can be found on pickup servers.

### 1.4 Where And How To Improve

With best practices, map strategies, and the meta game changing ever so often, this won't be covered in this guide.

There are various ways to learn how to play competitive Team Fortress 2. For example, on youtube you can find multiple videos explaining the gameplay loop and what to do.
In addition, a mentor can help with understanding the basics and improving on them later on.

The rule of thumb is, when you play, you will get better no matter what. Joining mixing servers and playing tf2center is good practice while you are not on a team, scrims will provide greater value than these options though. But most importantly, have fun!

### 1.5 How To Find A Mentor

Getting a mentor can help you and your team improve and learn from the experience of others.
There are dedicated channels on the ETF2L discord server where you can look at people or post a request yourself.
If you can’t find anything, don’t worry. Simply look at high division teams and begin messaging people that play the class you are looking for.
Keep in mind though that mentoring is done entirely voluntarily, so keep a polite tone and don’t demand mentoring.

### 1.6 How To Play Right Now

If you are not on a team, the best way to start out is to grab a friend to play tf2center.
Preferably that friend should have some experience playing competitive Team Fortress 2 (lower skill level might be of benefit here).
If you cannot find someone, you can always ask on the ETF2L discord server.

### 1.7 How To Find A Scrim

Finding a scrim for your team is done via the dedicated channel on the ETF2L discord server.
The common format used is “\<division> \<time in CET>'”.
Examples: open 20 - low 19/20 - ….

Once you find someone looking for the same, you can message them and you both decide what maps you want to play.
You might also get asked to host a game, you can do so by using serveme.tf to get a free server.
Once you got the server, exchange the connect information and done.
It's worthwhile to have one person on your team who is aware how to host servers and load the correct map/config.

### 1.7 How To Be A Mercenary

Once you feel comfortable enough with the basics, you might want to be a mercenary too, when you don't have a scrim.
You can let people know you are available in the dedicated channel on the ETF2L discord server.
The format usually looks like this: “can \<class> \<division> \<time>”
Examples: can scout open 19/20 - can demo low 21 - ….

## 2.Common Questions

### 2.1 Is this like Valve Competitive?

No, not at all. There are very different rules enforced and different maps played altogether.

### 2.2 Do I need a microphone?

Yes, giving information to your teammates is essential when playing competitive Team Fortress 2.
If you feel uncomfortable with doing so, don’t worry, there are very nice people in this community.

### 2.3 Do I need a good PC?

No, using tools like mastercomfig, even very low end PCs are able to play competitive.

### 2.4 Is there an hours requirement?

Technically, no there isn’t. Practically, if you havent played many FPS games, it will be hard to ….

### 2.5 Will I need to pay money to play?

No, playing in ETF2L is completely free, as opposed to other leagues like RGL, where in higher divisions, you will need to pay money.

### 2.6 Do I need specific TF2 items?

That can depend on what class you play.
But if you run into some unlockable weapons you need, they can be bought for a few cents, or someone ask someone on your team if they can gift you some missing ones.

### 2.7 How do I get help from an ETF2L Admin?

By going onto the ETF2L discord and messaging the bot on there with whatever questions you got, Please don’t message admins directly.
Be aware that admins work voluntarily and might take some time to respond, so be patient.

### 2.8 I have technical difficulties, what can I do?

Either you message the ETF2L admins, they can help you with issues regarding the league, or you go to the mastercomfig discord server, there you can find many
people that can assist you with issues regarding Team Fortress 2.

### 2.9 I have a question that’s not covered in this guide, what do I do?

A good first start is the ETF2L FAQ, if this still doesn’t answer your question, feel free to ask in the general ETF2L discord chat or open an admin ticket.

### 2.10 Where can I see when the next season starts?

The ETF2L news page announces each season and their dates. T
here will also be announcements regarding anything concerning ETF2L as a whole, it’s worth it to check in once in a while to see if anything happened.

### 2.11 What maps are being played?

A list of competitive maps can be found at comp.tf. (Note, some maps might be missing, to be really sure what maps are being played, check out the ETF2L announcement page)
Maps frequently get updated and thereby change the versioning in their name. Be sure to always use the newest maps, as they will be played in the season.

Not all maps are in each season, this is called rotation.
For example, in one season they rotated out cp_process, in the next one, they rotated out cp_snakewater.

### 2.12 How can I create my own ETF2L team?

Using the “team admin” tab on the ETF2L website, you can create new teams, set a name, picture and description.

### 2.13 How can I add someone to my ETF2L team?

Using the “team admin” tab on the ETF2L website, you can send invites to team members. Once they accept, they will be listed on the team page.
After 24h, they will also be verified and allowed to play official games as usual.
Be aware that you are only allowed to be rostered on one team per format.

### 2.14 Are there rewards for playing a season?

Yes, for playing a season, you will be awarded a medal, an in-game item you can equip.
Medals are distributed by admins in bulk and might take quite a bit of time (usually around 6-12 months) until they are handed out.

## 3.Manners

### 3.1 Timezones

In ETF2L, CET (or UTC+1) is the norm when talking about time.
This makes it easier for everyone to organize scrims, when to be in the voice chat, etc.
Be aware of CEST as well. During summertime, 1 hour is added, this is the daylight saving time for some countries and is also used for ETF2L.

### 3.2 Scrim Times

It’s collectively agreed that scrims are being played at 19, 20 and 21.
Many people playing competitive work or go to school and get home late.
Of course you can play games at other times, but these usually will only be mixes.

### 3.3 Bans

In ETF2L, admins will issue bans for racism, homophobia, harassment, cheating and so on even outside of official games.
Specific rules can be found under the ETF2L rules page.

### 3.4 Behaviour towards admins and mentors

Be aware that both league admins and mentors are doing their respective work voluntarily and don’t owe you anything.
Give them the time they might need and be patient and respectful.
