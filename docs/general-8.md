## 8.1. Default dates

ETF2L sets a Default Date for all matches based on the submitted available playing days for both teams. Teams can still play on a different date if both teams agree, but not after the deadline for the match.

Note: Teams do NOT have to reschedule matches which have been given a Default Date.

## 8.2. Heavy Fist Fight

A Heavy Fist Fight can be used to settle arguments over map pick advantages and/or choice of sides (i.e. RED and BLU). Please only use a Heavy Fist Fight to settle an argument when it is explicitly stated in the rules of the competition or advised by a League Admin.

One Heavy from each team participates in a melee fist fight. The winning team gets to decide which side to start on or who gets the map pick advantage in a situation where both teams are equally seeded. Only the stock Fists are allowed. Weapon-switching, buffs, healing of any kind, taunting, camping and/or fleeing is not allowed. Multiple Heavies from each team are allowed as well if both teams agree.

Note: specifically for Highlander, it is not mandatory for a team’s designated Heavy player to be chosen for a Heavy Fist Fight.

## 8.3. Picks/Bans System

This system is used to decide maps for playoffs and tiebreaker matches when specified by the competition.

Both teams need to agree on who eliminates first. If the two teams cannot agree, they need to perform a Heavy Fist Fight [[Explanation](#82-heavy-fist-fight)]. The winner of this Heavy Fist Fight can decide which team is Team A and which is Team B.

- Team A eliminates a map
- Team B eliminates a map
- Team B picks a map
- Team A picks a map
- Team B bans a map
- Team A bans a map
- The remaining map is the decider map

A map pool consisting of seven maps is assumed. If less maps are available, instructions on how to proceed will be given on the match page.

## 8.4. Loser’s Pick System

These systems are used to decide maps for playoffs and tiebreaker matches when specified by the competition.

For any matches where both teams are not equally seeded (e.g. playoffs), the following system has to be used.

- The higher seeded team picks the first map
- The loser of the first map picks the second map
- The loser of the second map picks the tiebreaker map (if necessary)

For any matches where both teams are equally seeded (e.g. tiebreaker matches, cups), the following system has to be used:

- Both teams need to agree on the first map. If the two teams can not agree, they need to perform a Heavy Fist Fight [[Explanation](#82-heavy-fist-fight)].
- The loser of the first map picks the second map
- The loser of the second map picks the tiebreaker map (if necessary)
