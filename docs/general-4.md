title: 4. Premiership Only Rules

## 4.1. Premiership players must always use their ETF2L nicknames during officials

All players who play a match in the Premiership tier must play with their ETF2L nickname. Team tags and sponsorship additions are allowed, but the nickname should be displayed exactly as is on ETF2L. Each incorrect nickname will warrant a separate Minor Warning; a team can receive this punishment multiple times per game.

Premiership players are not allowed to change their ETF2L nickname while the relevant season is underway.

## 4.2. Premiership teams have a limited amount of team name changes

All Premiership teams are allowed to change their team name to a maximum amount of 3 times per competition. This applies from the day the competition’s main season starts until the team does not have any upcoming matches to play in said competition.

If a team has already reached the maximum amount of team name changes in a competition and wants to change their team name again, they must contact a League Admin before doing so, otherwise the team will get a separate Minor Warning for each additional change; a team can receive this punishment multiple times per season.

## 4.3. SourceTV demos for premiership matches are mandatory

For every match in the Premiership tier, it is mandatory to upload SourceTV demo files for all maps played.

The responsibility to upload the files is on the team that owns the server or, if the server is owned by neither team, on the team that acquired the server.

In case of a server technical failure backed up by evidence the demo files do not have to be uploaded.

Failure to upload a demo file until 72 hours have passed after an official was scheduled to start will be punished with a Minor Warning for the responsible team. Repeated offenses will be punished with a Major Warning each. These warnings can be removed if the associated demo files are provided before the end of the competition’s regular season (i.e. before the release of playoffs fixtures).

## 4.4. Penalties during Premiership Playoffs and Tiebreakers

Specific Minor and Major Warnings now result in a cut of any prize money in that specific competition. A Minor Warning results in 10% of any cash prize won being docked; a Major Warning results in 30% being docked. All percentage-based cash prize docking stacks multiplicatively. Please note that admin discretion is applied to every single case related to penalties in the Premiership Playoffs.

Only specific Minor and Major Warnings are covered by this rule. They include, but are not limited to:

- Flaming
- Violating a competition’s merc clause
- Using an unregistered player
- Nickname rule violation
- Fraud attempt
- Using a banned player
- Cheating
- Missing, wrong, or incomplete console status screenshot

As a special rule, forfeiting or not showing up to a match in the Premiership Playoffs is punishable by 50% of any cash prize won being docked.
