>   - Bugging player model animations (e.g. entering civilian/reference poses)
>   - Bypassing the server sv_cheats setting to enable any in-game cheat command like showing wireframes, removing map fog, thirdperson mode etc. (punishable with a Cheating ban if used anywhere in TF2, see 6.4. Game Modifications)
>   - Damaging/Killing players during setup time
>   - Abusing record;stop to see invisible Spies
>   - Pyro: Any methods that extend crit or invincibility times when using the Phlogistinator.

>   - Pyro: Storing the stomp ability with the Thermal Thruster.
>   - Engineer: Exploit that allows you to double hit players, buildings and sappers with your melee weapon in a single attack.
>   - Sniper: Crouch Sniper Peeking / Cornersniping
>   - Sniper: Any method that allows for a faster re-zoom in order to use the time gained during the reload animation to negate the headshot delay, allowing you to hit headshots as soon as the weapon is able to fire.
>   - As an example: cl_autorezoom 1 and jumping is allowed; however it is not allowed to take advantage of it in an impactful way via a combination with special movement (e.g. c-tapping) or the usage of map terrain (e.g. doorways or low ceilings or higher elevated areas/props) with the intent to negate the headshot delay.
>   - Using weapons with bugged names to exceed their intended symbol limit and being able to hide crucial information in most HUDs.
