## 1.1. Tier System

All teams will be split into different tiers according to their skill level, past season results and stability. In the Premiership and Division tiers teams will be distributed into groups of eight teams where each will play against the others in a Round Robin format. In the remaining tiers, every team will play weekly fixtures against similarly skilled opponents in a Swiss-Style System. All of these matches will be played during the competition’s regular season, which will last seven weeks.

Two maps are played per official match during the regular season. League points are awarded based on the final result of each map:

- Regular wins award 3 points
- Regular losses award 0 points
- “Golden Cap” wins award 2 point
- “Golden Cap” losses award 1 point

A “Golden Cap” is defined as a decider round played on a map to determine its winner. Decider rounds are defined on a per-gamemode basis.

League points are awarded purely by the final result of a map. Aside from the necessity of “Golden Cap” rounds, the number of captures has no effect on league points themselves. Captures only determine which team wins a map.

## 1.2. Playoffs and Tiebreakers

The playoffs stage will be held after the regular season ends. Its schedule can be found on the competition’s [[homepage](
https://etf2l.org/6v6-home/)].

For playoffs official matches, maps will be chosen by the participating teams using the Picks/Bans Map Elimination System, with seeding coming from their relative placement in the regular season. [[Explanation](/docs/general-8#83-picksbans-system)]

Teams tied for any playoffs spots in their respective tier will be ordered using the following methods, ordered by priority:

- Head-to-Head (if applicable)
- Sonneborn-Berger Score
- Total Rounds scored

If the first method does not split the teams, the second method will be used. If the second method does not split the teams, the third method will be used.

The Neustadtl Sonneborn-Berger Score is calculated as follows:

1. For each match, calculate the ratio of points the team earned compared to the maximum, and multiply this by the opponent’s total score in the competition. Use only scores and opponents from “valid” matches  (matches that were not default wins and were not against dropped opponents).
2. Calculate the sum of all scores calculated via the above method.
3. Divide the sum by the number of “valid” matches played.

## 1.3. Mercenary clause

Definition:
Mercenaries or “Mercs” or “ringers” are defined as players who are not part of a team’s roster. Players who are listed as “unverified” on a roster also count as mercs if they were listed as such at the time an official was set to start.

Standard:
A team can use up to a maximum of 2 mercs (including default merc) per map and simultaneously, even if the opponent would allow the use of more than 2 mercs.
A team can only use 1 default merc as per rule [[1.3.2 Default Mercs](#132-default-mercenary)].
Otherwise, no team may use a merc at any time during a match unless the player(s) is/are granted explicit written permission to play by the opposing team.

Process:
Merc permission grants are player-based and class-based: teams are free to choose whether a player is allowed to play for their opponents as a merc and which classes they are allowed to play. Classes deemed as “off-classes” (i.e. Pyro, Heavy, Engineer, Sniper and Spy) are allowed by default. If no specific classes are stated, a player allowed to play as a merc can play any class of their choice.

All agreements for merc permission grants and the usage of default mercs must be logged and provided in the official match’s respective comments. Those logs must explicitly contain links to each approved merc’s ETF2L profile. Teams are advised to check if the proposed default merc is indeed eligible as per rule [[1.3.2 Default Mercs](#132-default-mercenary)].
All mercs have to be registered on ETF2L.

The team that requested the merc is responsible for making sure that this permission is granted. If a team wants to use any players who are not eligible to be a default merc, they must contact the opponent before the match starts.

Breaking the rules:
Failing to present a default merc to the opposing team will grant you a minor warning.
A team using an unapproved merc or an unregistered player will receive a minor warning and Default Loss.

### 1.3.1. “Permanent mercenary” are not tolerated

A player can only be used as a merc a limited number of times for the same team during a competition (regardless of the player being an approved merc or a default merc). The limit depends on the season length:

7-week seasons → maximum of 3 matches
5-week seasons → maximum of 2 matches

Exceeding the allowed limit will result in the player being considered a permanent merc for that team, and the team may be subject to penalties.

Once a player has reached the maximum number of allowed merc appearances for a team, they are no longer eligible to play as a merc or join that team for the remainder of the competition.

All cases of players being caught or reported as permanent merc are reviewed individually, with any decisions being made at the full discretion of the admin team. All circumstances will be taken into account.

Note: In accordance with [[General Rule 2.3](/docs/general-2#23-two-team-change-per-competition-allowed)], two team changes per competition are tolerated.

### 1.3.2. Default mercenary

One merc is allowed by default in all divisions:

Each team may use one default mercenary per official match.
A player may be used as a default merc if their experience tier matches the division of the match, as determined by [Rule 2.7 Player Experience].
For Fresh division matches, players eligible as default mercs in Open may also merc in Fresh.
Default mercs must not be class-restricted.
Teams must present their default merc to opponents before the match.

If you wish to contest the default status of a merc, please contact a League Admin on [[ETF2L’s Discord server](https://discord.etf2l.org/)] so they may decide whether or not the player is valid for the Default merc clause.

## 1.4. Teams with three Default Losses or two Default Losses in a row will be expelled from the season

If a team receives a third Default Loss during the competition, or two Default Losses in a row, they will be expelled from the league for the running season.

## 1.5 Roster Lock & Late Joiners
A roster lock comes into effect with the release of finalized tiers.
All new player additions must be admin-approved.
Players may only join as late joiners if their experience level matches the division of the team.
Note: As Fresh is intended strictly for new players, any previous experience **may** disqualify players from joining a Fresh team as a late joiner.


**This roster lock lasts until the start of the final week of the regular season, after that:**
A full roster lock is enforced.
No new players may be added until the season ends.
At season’s end (or no later than the time of the wrap-up post), roster locks are lifted.
